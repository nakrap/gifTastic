A look at some of the greatest cartoons ever made before gifs were a thing. :)

The point of the app is to allow users to search the giphy database of some of the best cartoons ever created!!!


## How it Works:

Inlcuded are a few examples of already made buttons of cartoons. Click on any of the pre-made buttons to show 10 gifs of that specific cartoon. Some of the features included are a start and stop toggle click function, and the ability to add a cartoon of your own.

## Running the app:
```
1. Begin by clicking one of the pre-made buttons to reveal 10 gifs of that cartoon!
2. Click on any of the displayed gifs to start and stop the animation. 
3. Input the name of a cartoon in the top search bar.
4. Click on the newly created button to display a new 10 gifs. 
```
