A look at some of the greatest cartoons ever made before gifs were a thing. :)

The point of the app is to allow users to search the giphy database of some of the best cartoons ever created!!!


Prerequisites:

Inlcuded are a few examples of already made buttons of cartoons. Click on any of the pre-made buttons to show 10 gifs of that specific cartoon. 
You can click on any on the gifs to toggle between playing the gif and stopping it.
You can also use the text field to add another cartoon that you think may make the list of greatest of all time! 
Once you create your own button, click on it to show 10 gifs. 


Running the app:

In order to run the application correctly, you will have to either click one of the buttons with cartoons already published. Or create a button of your own, and click that once it's created.
